# AI Interview Coach

## Overview

**AI Interview Coach** is an interactive platform that simulates technical interviews by generating job-related questions and evaluating answers using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The application helps users improve their responses by analyzing content, structure, and confidence scores.

## Key Features

- **NLP-Based Answer Evaluation:** Assesses responses using **Hugging Face NLP models**.
- **Confidence Scoring:** Provides feedback on the relevance and quality of responses.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with **React.js** for seamless interaction.
- **Flask Backend:** Handles AI processing and response evaluation.

## What I Learned

### **Technical Skills:**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Implemented **Hugging Face transformers** for analyzing and evaluating answers.
- **Speech Recognition:** Integrated **Speech-to-Text APIs** to convert spoken responses into text.
- **Backend Development:** Built a **Flask API** to handle user input and AI processing.
- **Frontend Development:** Created an interactive UI using **React.js**.
- **RESTful API Communication:** Facilitated seamless interaction between frontend and backend.

### **Problem-Solving & Optimization:**
- **Accuracy Improvement:** Fine-tuned NLP models for better question evaluation.
- **Handling Variability:** Managed diverse user inputs and improved response adaptability.
- **Data Flow Optimization:** Ensured efficient processing of large text inputs.


## How to Run the Project

### **Backend (Flask API):**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### **Frontend (React.js):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Flask, Hugging Face NLP
- **APIs:** Speech-to-Text, OpenAI/GPT-based processing
- **Other Tools:** Python, JavaScript, Node.js

## Future Enhancements

- **Voice Modulation Analysis:** Evaluate tone and speech clarity.
- **Adaptive Questioning:** AI adjusts difficulty based on user performance.
- **Detailed Feedback Reports:** Provide in-depth insights on responses.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Expand to non-English interviews.

## Conclusion

This project showcases my expertise in **AI, NLP, full-stack development, and interactive applications**. It highlights my ability to integrate **machine learning models** into real-world use cases while optimizing user experience.
